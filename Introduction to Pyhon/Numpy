# 1-1 IMPORT NUMPY & CREATE ARRAY
# # Create list baseball
# baseball = [180, 215, 210, 210, 188, 176, 209, 200]
# # Import the numpy package as np
# import numpy as np
# # Create a numpy array from baseball: np_baseball
# np_baseball = np.array(baseball)
# # Print out type of np_baseball
# print(type(np_baseball))
#
# 1-2 BOOLEAN NUMPY ARRAY
# # height_in and weight_lb are available as a regular lists
# # Import numpy
# import numpy as np
# # Calculate the BMI: bmi
# np_height_m = np.array(height_in) * 0.0254
# np_weight_kg = np.array(weight_lb) * 0.453592
# bmi = np_weight_kg / np_height_m ** 2
#
# # Create the light array
# light = bmi<21
#
# # Print out light
# print(light)
#
# # Print out BMIs of all baseball players whose BMI is below 21
# print(bmi[light]) <- Use light inside square brackets to do a selection on the bmi array.
