# 2. DICTIONARY
# 2-1. WHY USE DICTIONARIES?
# Motivation of using dictionary is due to too much work for indexes.
# See below for example.
# countries = ['spain', 'france', 'germany', 'norway']
# capitals = ['madrid', 'paris', 'berlin', 'oslo']
# ind_ger=countries.index('germany')
# print(capitals[ind_ger])
# result --------> berlin.
# * The above is by storing the index of germany from the countries list to ind_ger.
# * Then, by using this index to access the same index in the capitals list.
# 
# 2-2. TO CREATE DICTIONARIES
# See below for example.
# countries = ['spain', 'france', 'germany', 'norway']
# capitals = ['madrid', 'paris', 'berlin', 'oslo']
# europe = {'spain':'madrid', 'france':'paris', 'germany':'berlin', 'norway':'oslo'}
# Countries and capitals combined will be europe.
# Use curly brackets.
#
# 2-3. HOW TO ACCESS DICTIONARIES
# Definition of dictionary
# europe = {'spain':'madrid', 'france':'paris', 'germany':'berlin', 'norway':'oslo' }
# Print out the keys in europe
# print(europe.keys())
# result ------> dict_keys(['spain', 'france', 'germany', 'norway'])
# Print out value that belongs to key 'norway'
# print(europe["norway"])
# result ------> oslo
#
# 2-4 DICTIONARY MANIPULCATION
# Adding Dictionary is same as assigning
# ex. europe["germany"] = "berlin"
# If germany was not in europe Dictonary before, berlin will be added as germany:berlin
# If germany was in Dictionary, the value before will change to germany:berlin.
# 
# for adding a dictionary under dictionary, do as below.
# 1. Create another dictionary. ex / data = { "capital":"rome", "population":59.83 }
# 2. Add new dictionary to the other dictionary. ex / europe["italy"] = data
#
# To delete a component of dictionary, do as below.
# del(europe["italy"])
#
# To check dictionary, find out boolean.
# print("italy" in europe)
# If True than it's in the dictionary
